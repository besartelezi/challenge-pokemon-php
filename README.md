# PHP, (not that) Pretty Huge (of a) Problem
For this challenge, I will be making a Pokédex again, but this time I will make it with PHP, and not with Javascript. 
If you want to check out my previous JS Pokédex, [here is the repository](https://github.com/besartelezi/ajax-pokedex), and [here is the Pokédex itself](https://besartelezi.github.io/ajax-pokedex/). </br>

This will be the very first time in my entire life that I will be using PHP. 
But, because I know Javascript, PHP should not be that huge of a problem. 
I will be using the HTML and JS I already wrote for my previous Pokédex for this one, but I will be changing all the JS to PHP. </br>

I'm assuming there are a lot of similarities between JS and PHP, but at the end of the day they are two different programming languages.
issues will most definitely occur, but I will handle them accordingly. <br>

I really like this challenge, since it will prove that once I have learned my first programming language, I can learn other programming languages way faster.
It also goes to show how adaptability and a strong drive to learn are some of the most important qualities you can have in the IT sector.

## The most ample way to learn things, is by ex-ample
I won't be expecting to be a PHP master at the end of this assignment, but I will be expecting to have a better understanding of the fundamentals of PHP.
I also expect to learn these things, through the knowledge I have gained from Javascript.
By using everything I did in Javascript as an example, I'm more that confident enough that I wil learn PHP at an adequate speed.
**The most ample way to learn things, is by ex-ample.** <br>

I have found a rather strange problem with PHP though, but I was able to resolve it.
